The factory method pattern is a creational pattern,
that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects 
without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.”
The Factory Pattern helps abstract away the details of creating an object we need. 
It now becomes the factory’s responsibility of deciding what object to create and how to create it.
